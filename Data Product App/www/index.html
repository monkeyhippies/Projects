<h1>Documentation:</h1>

<p>Use this app if you want to calculate the power of your experiment.  You can also use this app to get a ballpark estimate of how many observations you need to take, given a preferred statistical power, alpha, and estimated sigma.</p>
<br>
<h3>Input the 4 parameters in the sidepanel:</h3>
<br>	
<ul>
	<li>1. Number of Observations</li>
	<li>2. alpha (.05 is standard for most experiments)</li>
	<li>3. sigma (this is the population standard deviation)  This should be an estimate if you don't have the data to calculate sigma</li>
	<li>4. Estimated Detectable difference (This is the estimated difference in the means of the distributions of your two competing hypotheses (null and alternative))</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main Panel Output:</h3>
<br>	
<ul>
	<li>Check to make sure the app read in the correct parameters.</li>
	<li>The calculated power is displayed, and a plot showing the distributions of the two hypotheses and a line marking alpha.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
